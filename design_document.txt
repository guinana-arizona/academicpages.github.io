The website is now operational, though it's still largely a clone of the original distribution.
Next steps should be reformatting the website, making it more unique. At minimum, the landing page should be cleaned up,
and should contain the links I want visitors to see.

At minimum, these links should include:
 - a link to my GitHub account page;
 - a link to my LinkedIn account page;
 - a link to view/download my CV;

Also:
 - a picture of me :^)
